# Mini-Leet: Leetcode Revisor and Tracker

*Mini-Leet* is designed for individuals who struggle to stay consistent with their daily LeetCode challenges and coding practice. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, Mini-Leet is designed to streamline your problem-solving journey and keep you on track to achieve your goals.

The LeetCode Revision Chrome extension is designed to help users improve their problem-solving skills by providing random LeetCode problems on a daily basis. This tool encourages users to stay engaged with daily coding challenges, promoting continuous learning and growth. In addition to presenting daily problems, the extension displays valuable insights about the user's LeetCode progress, such as the total number of problems solved and how many problems have been solved by difficulty (easy, medium, and hard). 

The extension also features Google Sign-In integration, allowing users to log in with their Google account for a personalized experience. Once signed in, the extension fetches and displays the user's LeetCode profile data, making it easy to track progress and set new goals. With a clean, simple interface, the extension offers an intuitive way to stay motivated, challenge yourself, and track your progress in solving coding problems on LeetCode.

How It Works:
Queue Management
The extension uses MongoDB to manage the queue of LeetCode problems. The queue is persistent, meaning that once a problem is added, it stays in the queue until the user marks it as "Concept Cleared".

Random Problem: Fetches a random LeetCode problem from an external API or a pre-defined list stored in MongoDB.
Revision Queue: Problems are added to the revision queue and revisited regularly.
Concept Cleared: When the user feels they've mastered a problem, they can mark it as cleared, which removes it from the queue.

The LeetCode Revision Chrome Extension is designed to help you practice LeetCode problems regularly and efficiently. The extension pulls random LeetCode problems, manages a revision queue, and helps you clear problems once you've mastered them. The extension uses MongoDB to persist the revision queue and user progress.

## The Concept Behind Our Idea
As third years studying for placements, we often find ourselves needing a convenient way to be able to track our progress on Leetcode and manage our revision efficiently. Having to further exhaust ourselves on top of already having to solve complex problems, becomes a difficult task when we're on both a time constraint and immense amounts of pressure. This Chrome exensions offers a solution for those placement-oriented students who wish to manage their time and ensure proper learning along with managing their daily tasks. 

This app seamlessly integrates with a person's LeetCode Account and allows for spaced repitition in learning, thereby cementing the concepts you've learnt into your memory for longer periods of time.

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves revisiting concepts at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention. This extension implements the spaced repetition principle by:

Queuing problems for repeated revision: The extension automatically adds problems to a revision queue. Users are prompted to solve the same problems multiple times at regular intervals, ensuring they revisit concepts at optimal intervals.
Tracking mastery: As users mark a problem as “Concept Cleared,” they remove it from the queue, indicating that they no longer need to revisit the problem as frequently.

By revisiting the same problem multiple times, spaced repetition helps reinforce the problem-solving techniques and concepts learned, leading to better retention.
